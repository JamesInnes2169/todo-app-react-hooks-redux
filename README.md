## Todo App
I cloned and ran every single todo app listed to have redux-starter-kit as a dependancy on GitHub. The ones that even ran wern't up to date with new react hooks and redux syntax. Hopefully you won't find this example to be just as shit :)

create-react-app  
typescript  
redux-starter-kit  
persisted store with local storage  
arrow functions  
hooks  
react-bootstrap
